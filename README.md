# Fundament

A modern and lightweight front-end framework built on the shoulders of giants and ready to compete with them. The secret recipe for Fundament is a lot of love and passion, sprinkled with a bit of arrogance on top. Fundament takes the pain out of developing web applications while focussing on page speed and user experience. We have tried to get the best out of several well-known frameworks, as well as to implement our own views and thoughts.

- Designed for the developer
